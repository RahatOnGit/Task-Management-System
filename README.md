Technologies used here are

Development process
-------------------

- The user registration, login and logout are handled by Breeze (for web) and Sanctum (for API) packages.

- For storing all the tasks data, I have created a table named 'all_tasks'.

- Here, at the table 'all_tasks', I have added 6 fields for storing the task data. These 6 fields are user_id(Foreign key), taskname, details, date, time, status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).

- user_id is the Primary key of the User Table.

- To create, read, update or delete a new task, user authentication is checked. 

- To read, update or delete a task, authenticated user id should be same to the user_id field value of the 'all_tasks' table.

- All the tasks of a user is sorted in ascending order of due date and time. Then, all the tasks data are shown.

- When a user use  filter by status, filtered tasks are also sorted in ascending order of due date and time. Then, the filtered tasks are shown.
